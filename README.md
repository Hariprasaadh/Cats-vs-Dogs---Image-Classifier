# Cats-vs-Dogs---Image-Classifier

The goal of this project is to build a CNN-based image classifier that can accurately classify images of cats and dogs. The classifier is trained on a large dataset of labeled images and can be used to predict the class of new, unseen images.

Model Architecture

The CNN model used in this project consists of the following layers:

1. Convolutional layers
2. Max Pooling layers
3. Flattening
4. Fully Connected (Dense) layers
   
The model is built using the Keras API with TensorFlow as the backend.
